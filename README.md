# Eikonomia
*pun between "eiko" and "enkanomiya" which is also the name used by enka.network fetching genshin in-game data.*

This is a piece of software aiming at:
1. Fetching equipment regularly of my characters using enka.network and saving them into a local database
2. Providing this parsed data locally and continuously with API and stuff to be read using (my) Excel spreadsheet
3. Computing additional data easily notably regarding the quality of the artifacts which is currently not that intuitive and a bit wonky on my spreadsheet.
4. Entertaining me with the Julia language, and allowing me to play a bit with Docker.

## Installation
I aim at making the whole thing running on Docker, so for now there is nothing here.

## Dependencies
- Julia
- MongoDB
